## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

### What I learned

What I Learned While I Implemented the multistep form

- Leveraged Mantine Stepper to structure a clear, responsive multistep flow with custom layouts
- Fine-tuned form state management across steps, ensuring a smooth UX with dynamic validations and error handling
- Applied conditional logic to enable/disable steps and navigation based on user input
- Mastered how to persist form data when navigating between steps without unmounting components
- Implemented responsive, mobile-friendly design using Mantineâ€™s Grid, MediaQuery, and layout primitives
- Enhanced UX with hover, focus, and active states across all interactive components
- Created a final review step that summarizes selections and confirms user intent before submission
- Handled form validation and error feedback in a user-friendly way (e.g. missing fields, invalid email formats)
- Ensured a smooth step transition experience, avoiding full rerenders using efficient state and layout management
